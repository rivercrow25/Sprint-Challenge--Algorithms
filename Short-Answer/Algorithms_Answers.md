#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
the time complexity is O(n) due to a incrementing by n*n while the while loop comparison is n*n*n, it can be reduced to while a is less the n a += 1

b)
the time compexity is O(n^2) due to nested for loops even if j doubling

c)
the time complexity is O(n) due to a single decrementing recursive call
